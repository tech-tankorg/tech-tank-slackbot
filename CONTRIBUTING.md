# Contributing to this repository

---

So you want to contribute? Yay! Great! Fun! we love seeing new PRs our Tank bot. That being said, not every pull request will be merged. The general guidelines we'll follow are:

- Does it make developing the Tank bot easier?
- Are you doing a PR into the development branch?
- Does it fix a bug?
- Does it break anything?
- Does it stick to the original goal of the Tank bot?
- Does it reduce the build size?
- Is it necessary?

Regarding PRs into development, please make all PRs into the development branch because the main branch is reserved for production. Further, in regard to the last point, we don't expect all pull requests to be absolutely necessary. New features are good, however, if the new features make the bot unnecessarily complex in some way without bringing value to the community, it won't be merged.

## Ready to contribute?

1. Create a fork of the repo
2. Create a new branch using the format below
3. Work on your fork, then open a pull request
4. Your PR will be reviewed, and if it is approved it will be merged into development

### What to call your newly created branch

Create a new branch with the keyword of what you are planning to do. For example, if you're planning a new feature then the branch name may look like `feat-awesome-feature--octokat`. However, if you're adding a new test then the branch name may look like `test-awesome-tests--octokat`.
