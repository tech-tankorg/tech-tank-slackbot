# Contributing to this repository

---

So you want to contribute? Yay! Great! Fun! we love seeing new PRs our Tank bot. That being said, not every pull request will be merged. The general guidelines we'll follow are:

- Does it make developing the Tank bot easier?
- Are you doing a PR into the development branch?
- Does it fix a bug?
- Does it break anything?
- Does it stick to the original goal of the Tank bot?
- Does it reduce the build size?
- Is it necessary?

Regarding PRs into development, please make all PRs into the development branch because the main bramch is reserved for production. Further, in regard to the last point, we don't expect all pull requests to be absolutely necessary. New features are good, however, if the new features make the bot unnecessarily complex in some way without bringing value to the community, it won't be merged.
