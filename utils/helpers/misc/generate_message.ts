Welcome to the Tank (aka Tech Tank :tech-tank:)! We're so happy you're here:blue_heart:

This is a space for all techies (devs, designers, PMs and beyond) from newbies/juniors to senior level, and we hope you can make some meaningful connections here.

When you've had a moment to settle in, don't forget to head over to the <#${channels.intro}> channel to introduce yourself!

Afterwards, you can check out some of our other channels. Here's a list of our currently active channels you should consider joining:

• <#${channels.announcements}>: this is where we post all our important announcements for you to stay updated!

• <#${channels.networking}>: this is where we post all in-person and virtual networking/job-related events! We also have in-house virtual workshops that cover most job-search topics!

• <#${channels.social}>: we hang out a lot. We go climbing, play boardgames, for drinks/food, and many more! (Most of us are in Toronto - sorry if you're elsewhere :sob:)

• <#${channels.code_diversity}>: This channel is dedicated to celebrating women and non-binary folx in the tech space to promote inclusivity and diversity in our workspace and beyond! We've started this channel as a place for us to better collect and share resources, especially to support our monthly Women and Non-Binary Folk in-person meetings. This channel is public and is intended to remain public to promote inclusivity and mindful conversations.

• <#${channels.study}>: this is where we post information about study sessions (biweekly on Tuesdays) and you can ask any questions about code/study material/projects you're stuck on or need help debugging!

• <#${channels.job_posting}>: this is where we post jobs that we come across. For any job-search/job-prep related questions, we have a channel for that too... right below :)

• <#${channels.job_prep}>: A space that supports job-preppers through: resume/portfolio feedback, interview prep (including technical assessments), and mock interviews sessions!

• <#${channels.tank_toasts}>: This is where you can share your journey, and your wins, and even give kudos to your resilient fellow job search buddy, your fabulous mentor or mentee, or your cat that wakes you up every morning forcing you to start your day!

• <#${channels.random}>: just random stuff. no further explanation needed :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:

• <#${channels.rant_tank}>: a space to rant or complain about anything and everything:purple_heart:

• <#${channels.resources}>: post any notes/cool resources you come across!

• <#${channels.project_proposals}>: Do you have a cool project idea and need some team members? Do you want to join a project? If yes, then this is the place that allows you to share, create, and join projects!

• <#${channels.coffee_chat}>: This is where you go to join in on the social mixer for our Slack community!! Every other week (Mondays at 10 AM EST), Shuffl -- the master of pairs and groups -- works its magic to shuffle you into fresh groups of three via direct messages!

And of course, if you don't see an appropriate place to post, you can always just post in #general! We would also love to hear your ideas! So at anytime, feel free to use the "/suggestion" command to send your idea's directly to the admin team. 

Lastly, we wanted to provide you a link to our code of conduct which you can find <https://www.techtankto.com/code-of-conduct|here>.

If you have any questions or concerns at any time, please don't hesitate to contact <@${admins.chris}>, <@${admins.sammy}>, <@${admins.nonso}>, <@${admins.niya}>, <@${admins.riaz}>, <@${admins.neal}>, or <@${admins.eric}> your friendly admins:party_blob:

Thanks for reading, and we hope you have a good swim :fish:
